# How-To Guides

This section contains task-focused recipes for accomplishing specific goals
with the Hermes Extension API. Each guide shows you how to perform a concrete
task with minimal explanation.

## Available Guides

- [Read and Modify Messages](read-modify-messages.md) - Working with the editor
  content in different formats
- [Handle Events](handle-events.md) - React to message changes, opens, and saves
- [Show Dialogs](show-dialogs.md) - Display system dialogs for user input and
  feedback

  and validation

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide is self-contained and focuses on a specific task. The code examples
use Python for consistency, but the same patterns apply to any language that
can read/write JSON-RPC messages over stdio.

For conceptual explanations and design decisions, see the
[Explanation](../explanation/) section. For complete reference documentation,
see the [Reference](../reference/) section.
